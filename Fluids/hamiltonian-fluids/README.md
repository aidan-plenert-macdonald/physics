# Simulation of Hamiltonian Fluids

We run a many particle simulation in a box using the 
free particle Lagrangian and then compare the results to
a simulation of the Fluid Lagrangian computed via the 
formalism that I developed for translating
[Many Particle Systems to Fluids](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/335603/least-action-with-local-equilibrium)

For visual simplicity, I just simulate in 2D.
